    "# AIMA Docker Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to AIMA docker. This notebook will help you learn about the aima-docker container and serve as a jump site to other aima repositories. If you want to proceed to aima notebooks, go directly to the jump site. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jump site\n",
    "\n",
    " - [aima-python](aima-python/index.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Touring the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "aima-docker uses `conda` to manage multiple python virtual environments. All machine learning frameworks and their dependencies are installed in separate virtual environments. The environments currently available are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **tensorflow:** Contains tensorflow 1.13.1 and Keras\n",
    " - **pytorch:** Contains latest pytorch\n",
    " - **cntk:** Contains latest versions of cntk and Keras\n",
    " - **scikit-learn:** Contains latest scikit-learn\n",
    " - **nltk:** Contains latest nltk with support for *Stanford CoreNLP*.\n",
    " \n",
    "The base/root environment contains all packages required to run aima-python. Package dependencies can be managed on the `Conda` tab of Jupyter Notebook home. To install new packages in an environment, go to the `Conda` tab and click on the environment. You should then be able to edit the environment packages in the package management window highlighted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Package Management Screen](images/env_management.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the package management window allows you to create environments and manage their packages efficiently, it only lists the packages that are available on official conda channels. In many cases, you will need to install packages from PyPi, other conda channels, or even build them from source. To enable this, Jupyter can be used to provide terminal access to the container. You can start a terminal just like you start a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "![How to start a Terminal](images/terminal_start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on `Terminal` in `new` menu gives us the bash we all know and love.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Terminal Screenshot](images/terminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you must keep in mind that the additional packages installed on your container will not persist across Jupyter sessions and will be deleted whenever you restart the container. If you want a package to be permanently added to aima-docker, raise a Github issue detailing why the package is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Persistent Storage for Custom Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We know you might want to create new Jupyter Notebooks, execute your code, or import datasets into the container. Good News! Doing so is effortless. Whenever you are working with aima-docker, the `code` folder in the container synchronizes with the folder at `~/aima-docker` on your system. This means that everything you import in this folder will be available on the aima-docker container and persist even if you restart it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coupled with your favorite text editor and the Jupyter bash, you can create and execute any scripts you like on the aima-docker container. We also recommend that you keep any data your models require in this folder. This is because everything in the folder's subtree is persistent, and doing so will save your scripts from downloading data every time the container is restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminating the Container \n",
    "\n",
    "aima-docker container runs as a daemon by default. Don't worry though, terminating the container is easy. Go to Jupyter home and click the `Quit` button. That's it; you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Closing aima-docker](images/quit_jupyter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter is running with authentication disabled, isn't this a security flaw?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Jupyter Notebooks running without authentication is a security flaw, this is not so for the aima-docker container. Authentication is required since anyone with access to Jupyter on your network can essentially execute any code on your machine. However, since we are running aima-docker inside a non-privileged container with a non-root user, your machine is isolated from whatever code is executed on Jupyter. Therefore, anyone with access to aima-docker's Jupyter will not be able to execute arbitrary codes on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributors run Jupyter as a root user, won't it compromise security?\n",
    "\n",
    "Token authentication is enabled for contributors. Therefore, only they can access their Jupyter notebooks from their browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## My changes don't persist across different sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers are meant to be ephemeral and stateless, i.e., they are intended to be created and destroyed often without any changes in state. aima-docker provides a `code` folder which is bound to your local system to allow for some persistent storage. Read **Persistent Storage for Custom Models** section above for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're a docker virtuoso, you can remove the *--rm* flag from the docker run command. This will not delete your container whenever it closes, and you can then use\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker start *container name*\n",
    "\n",
    "to restart the same container. Needless to say, *all* your changes will be retained."
